### Flaskapp
Flask documentation can be found [here](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/index.html)

We're using one file per route

Double-check to make sure the project packages are as listed in 
requirements.txt, a bad version of Flask caused me major problems

To run with https, use `python3 flaskapp.py --cert=adhoc`
